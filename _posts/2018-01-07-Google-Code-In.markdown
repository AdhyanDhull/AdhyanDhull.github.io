description: Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 4500 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest. I participated in the 2016 edition and completed 13 tasks for the SCoRe organization, which got me a GCI T-shirt, pen and a laptop sticker! <br> The 2017 edition has been really better so far, with 28 tasks completed and over 80+ hours devoted to doing the quality tasks, I hope I make it as a Grand Prize Winner and meet my awesome mentors from <a href="https://github.com/scorelab/" target="blank">SCoRe</a>
